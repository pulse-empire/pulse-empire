## About

Welcome to the Shadow Arsenal, a collection of security research tools and techniques developed for the purpose of understanding and exploring potential vulnerabilities in systems and networks. This repository is a compilation of various projects, each focusing on different aspects of security research.

**Key Areas of Focus:**

* **Network Analysis & Reconnaissance:** Tools for passive and active information gathering.
* **Payload Crafting & Manipulation:** Techniques for custom data generation and testing.
* **Log Analysis & Forensics:** Scripts for examining and interpreting system logs.
* **Automation & Scripting:** Tools for automating security-related tasks.
* **Vulnerability Exploration:** Research-focused tools for understanding security weaknesses.

## Tool Index

1.  **Network Probe (`network-probe/`)**:
    * Description: A set of scripts for network reconnaissance and analysis.
    * Usage: `cd network-probe/ && ./probe.sh [target]`
    * Note: Focuses on passive network information.
2.  **Payload Generator (`payload-gen/`)**:
    * Description: Tools for crafting and manipulating custom payloads for testing.
    * Usage: `cd payload-gen/ && python3 gen.py [options]`
    * Note: Emphasizes data structure exploration.
3.  **Log Examiner (`log-examiner/`)**:
    * Description: Scripts for analyzing and interpreting system and application logs.
    * Usage: `cd log-examiner/ && python3 analyze.py [log-file]`
    * Note: Focuses on pattern recognition and anomaly detection.
4.  **Auto Scripter (`auto-scripts/`)**:
    * Description: Scripts for automating repetitive security research tasks.
    * Usage: `cd auto-scripts/ && ./run_tasks.sh`
    * Note: General purpose scripting.
5.  **Vulnerability Explorer (`vuln-explorer/`)**:
    * Description: Tools for exploring and understanding potential security vulnerabilities.
    * Usage: `cd vuln-explorer/ && python3 explore.py [target]`
    * Note: Research focused, no direct exploit code.
6.  **Data Obfuscator (`data-obfuscator/`)**:
    * Description: A set of tools to obfuscate data for privacy and security testing.
    * Usage: `cd data-obfuscator && python3 obfuscate.py [input_file]`
    * Note: For testing data handling.
7.  **Traffic Sniffer (`traffic-sniffer/`)**:
    * Description: Scripts to capture and analyse network traffic.
    * Usage: `cd traffic-sniffer && python3 sniffer.py [interface]`
    * Note: Focuses on traffic pattern analysis.
